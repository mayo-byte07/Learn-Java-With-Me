Welcome to my Java learning repository! 🚀 This project documents my journey from writing my first "Hello World" to mastering advanced Java concepts. I am building this from scratch, and I invite you to learn along with me.

## 📂 Current Progress: The Basics

Right now, I am focusing on the fundamentals of the language. You can find the code for these topics in the `Basic` folder.

| File Name | Concept Covered | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`Hello World.java`** | **Syntax & Setup** | The classic starting point to ensure the environment is ready. |
| **`Scanner.java`** | **User Input** | Learning how to take inputs from the user using the `Scanner` class. |
| **`greaterthan.java`** | **Conditionals** | Using `if-else` logic to compare numbers. |
| **`for-loop.java`** | **Control Flow** | Understanding loops to repeat tasks efficiently. |
| **`String-sum.java`** | **Operations** | Basic string concatenation and arithmetic operations. |

## 🗺️ Roadmap: What's Next?

I will be updating this repository regularly as I move to more complex topics:

- [x] **Basics** (Variables, Loops, Conditions, Input)
- [ ] **Arrays & Methods**
- [ ] **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** (Classes, Objects, Inheritance)
- [ ] **Exception Handling**
- [ ] **Collections Framework** (Lists, Sets, Maps)
- [ ] **File Handling & I/O**
- [ ] **Advanced Java** (Multithreading, Lambdas, Streams)

## 🛠️ How to Run These Codes

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Basic

3. **Compile and Run:**
   ```Bash
   javac filename.java
   java filename

Happy Coding! 💻
### Why this works for you right now:
* **Matches your screenshot:** It specifically lists `Scanner`, `for-loop`, `greaterthan`, etc., so it looks accurate immediately.
* **Status Badge:** I added a "Status: Learning Basics" badge so visitors know exactly where you are in the journey.
* **Scalable:** As you add a "OOP" or "Arrays" folder later, you can just change the `[ ]` to `[x]` in the Roadmap section.

Would you like me to show you how to add a "Table of Contents" automatically for when the repo gets bigger?
